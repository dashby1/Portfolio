Hi, I’m Daniel Ashby — a mechanical engineer with a strong foundation in aerospace, computation, and hands-on design. I’ll be graduating from Utah State University in May 2025 with dual bachelor’s degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics (emphasis in Computation), along with a minor in Computer Science.

I thrive at the intersection of engineering design, numerical modeling, and real-world problem-solving. My experience spans from designing subsystems for the world’s first 1MW wireless vehicle charging station at the ASPIRE Research Center, to conducting computational mathematics research simulating complex fluid interactions, to developing automated optical systems for a DARPA-funded atmospheric observatory.

Beyond research, I enjoy working on collaborative, big-picture projects. As a founding member of Aggie Solar Racing, I helped build Utah State’s solar car design team—leading efforts in aerodynamics, composites, and team organization. I also have experience coordinating student outreach and project planning through the ASPIRE Student Association.

## Technical Highlights:

CAD & mechanical design (SolidWorks CSWA, FEA, CFD)

Programming in Python, Java, C with applications in data analysis, simulation, and control systems

Strong background in applied mathematics, numerical methods, and computational modeling

Hands-on experience with high-power systems, optics, and embedded hardware

I’m passionate about aerospace propulsion, sustainable energy, and systems that push the boundaries of efficiency and innovation. My goal is to contribute to groundbreaking projects where engineering meets exploration—whether that’s in the skies, in space, or here on Earth.

When I’m not engineering, you’ll probably find me tinkering with radios, building side projects, or working outdoors
