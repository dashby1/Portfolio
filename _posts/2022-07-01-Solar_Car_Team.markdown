### Overview

### Year 1 (2022)
I got the idea to start the USU solar car team, Aggie Solar Racing, when I went to see the American Solar Challenge finish in Twin Falls, ID, that year. Here are some pictures of that event:

Needless to say, I was hooked. Within the next week, I got some of my buddies together at USU and we formed the Aggie Solar Racing team at USU. We would meet during the rest of the summer to try and make headway on the team and car but none of us really knew what we were doing.

Some progress was made on vehicle design, however, most of the progress made was just learning how to use techniques in CAD (such as weldments and surface modeling) to make a components as most of the components we made then were pretty hot garbage.

Going into the Fall semester, recruitment was a huge struggle, most of the people interested in the team left just as quickly as they came (I attribute this to us not having much of anything to show at the time, just some plans and mediocre CAD files). We did however managed to convince our first elecrical members! (Thanks Conner, Cayden, and Tim!) on the team to join during this time bringning our total team member count to about 4 (kinda) consistent memebrs! 

However, at this time most of the members were mainly focused on faculty research projects or coursework but would occasionaly help out with the occasional project or outreach which was still a huge help. 

We also got our first in-kind donation this October! 3 LiFePO4 battery modules from Dakota Lithium, these have been insurmountable in heloing us test things even with the car and final battery pack almost complete!

By the middle of the fall semester, I would be the only one showing up to the teams weekly meetings (which unfortunatley would follow into the Spring semester)

### Year 2 (2023)
This semster started of by attending the 2023 Solar car conference online. This was a huge help. I spent 2 days straight listening to talks and talking to experienced teams about solar car design and team management. During the solar car conference I got into contact with the team founder of the KU Solar car team which is now defunct. They were able to complete a car and compete but due to problems with their university were forced to shutdown. Their founder mentioned that their car was no just sitting in a barn rotting away, I shot him a message asking if our team could "adopt" it and he said that it was a possibility and got me into contact with the last team president. The team president unfortunatley said that they want to try starting the team back up again but if it doesn;t work out, that my team could have it.

No new members joined this semester evern though a large focus was at the start of the semester was recruitment. 

I went an bought a cheap motor and controller from amazon (I think it was a Vevor 2kW motor meant for an ebike or something). During this fall break, I and Tim met up and got a redumentary system to control our motor with. Here is a video of it working (essentially it just linearly ramped up to a predetermined speed when a button was pressed and then back down when released, we were able to also able to load custom ramping profiles as well)

Near the end of the semester, I decide to go and try and spectate the 2023 FSGP in Kansas that summer. We also got our first high school student(?!?!), Mitchell, to join the team (he was set to graduate in a month and was wondering what he could do to prepare to be on the team, which I promptly said he could be on the team right them if he wanted to be). I remebered that the KU team was located about a 30-45 minute drive away from the track so I messaged them about a week or 2 before the race asking if any of them were going and if they wanted to hangout and go do something as they probably wouldn't be competing. To my suprise, the team lead said that they never ended up reforming and that our team could have the car. I rented (probably the only reasonabley priced) trailer availabe (an aluminum flatbed trailer, which was a mistake, always get an enxlosed trailer when transoorting fragile vehicles, more on this later). Mitchell and I drove to Kansas watched the race and talked with teams and most importantly Picked up our new car!

The car was in very bad shape sitting in a humid barn for over a year. Frame was very rusted and the entire inside was full of rat feces and almost every wire had some some degree of insulation missing from rats chewing on it ranging from just a few nibbles out of it to entire wires being exposed (which was scary to see in the battery pack). Driving back to utah after an excellent event we ran into the worst rain storm I have ever driven through and our new (to us) solar car was completely exposed to torenchal rain and hail completely soaking it. Luckily nothing was powered on but having all the exposed wires in the battery box was no good. No incident occured but there was a bit more damage to wires and stuff coming loose and connectors braking on the drive back (which wasn't much of a factor as we planned on replacing all the wiring anyway)

The following weeks I got the car back up and running with our spare batters from dakota lithium, however there was still a lot of work to do as almost every part of the car either needed to be modified or completely redone.

I believe the only thing that wasn't an OTS part that we re-engineered was about 2/3s of the chassis (the 1/3 we changed was due to new suspension and battery mounting locations).

The following Fall semester was a great success (atleast compared the the previous 2 semesters) for recruitment. We went from having a handful members that would probably put a couple intermitent hours of work in every few weeks to about 7 dedicated members putting in consistent hours every week. 

We ended up cutting off and ditching the old shell of the car for a few reasons: 1. It wasn't filthy, absolutely full of rat poop as stated before (it actually made me sick for a day or 2 after I dealt with cleaning most of it out) 2. The top shell was in bad shape and needed to be redone anyway. 3. Having it one made working on the whole car a huge pain and destructivley cutting it off was the only way to take it off.

During the summer, the senior capstone professor actually reached out to our team asking our team if we wanted to make any part of our car into a capstone project, which I replied sure as it was essentially free money and captive members. The capstone project I chose to list was a new shell for the car.
