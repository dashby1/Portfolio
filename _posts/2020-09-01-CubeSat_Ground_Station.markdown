The GAS team, USU's amatuer satellite design team was the first design team I as a part of when I went to USU. I joined almost immediatley during my freshman year in the fall of 2020 and stayed until March of 2022.

During my time on the team, I quickly got promoted to the communications team lead just 3 months after joining. My main duty was building a functional ground station to communicate with the GASPACS cubesat which launched in December 2021.
